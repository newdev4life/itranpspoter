## Why iTransporter?

The official [Transporter](https://apps.apple.com/app/transporter/id1450874784) app requires you to sign in with your Apple ID directly, which can be problematic in certain scenarios:

- **Virtual macOS Systems** - VMs and cloud-based macOS environments often cannot authenticate with Apple ID due to system restrictions
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated build systems need a non-interactive way to upload IPAs
- **Team Workflows** - Developers may prefer using App-Specific Passwords instead of sharing Apple ID credentials
- **Security Concerns** - Using App-Specific Passwords limits access scope compared to full Apple ID login
- **No Full Xcode Required** - Only needs Xcode Command Line Tools, not the full 12GB+ Xcode installation
- **Transporter Without Login** - Just install the Transporter app from App Store, no need to sign in to it

iTransporter solves this by leveraging the `iTMSTransporter` command-line tool (bundled with Transporter) to upload IPAs using only your **Apple ID email** and an **App-Specific Password** — no interactive login required.
